// Things to do for this word guessing game //
// Always remember to code 1 piece at a time //
// When in doubt, or this assignment gives you a terrible headache, go for a walk, exercise, or sleep //
// Always remind yourself to breath and write to do's every after work so that you will remember what to do next and at the same try coding 1 piece at at time//
